# Personal-Key-Indicators-to-Prevent-Heart-Disease-for-Americans

As reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), heart disease is the
leading cause of death in the United States. Therefore, the objective of this report is to act as
data scientists and researchers to advocate younger generation of individuals with supporting
evidence on the topmost vital factors that could lead to getting heart disease in the future. This
information serves as an act of awareness for millennials and Gen-Z individuals who need to be
aware of these health care preventions. Our statistical model will facilitate social media
influencers in the healthcare and fitness industry to identify areas of improvement for visibility
and attention of the existing factors that one should be routinely checked upon.
A dataset from Kaggle was considered where real data was collected from the CDC on U.S.
residents' health status. A total of 319,795 data points are available in this dataset. The data
contains 18 features such as Body Mass Index (BMI), Race, Diabetic condition, Sex,
SleepTime, etc. From the respondents' information, 91.4% did not have heart disease, while
8.6% had heart disease. All of these features were considered while building 3 different
machine learning models to predict heart disease and identify the most important variables
contributing to this cardiac problem. The best model predicts heart disease with an accuracy
of 76% and AUC-ROC (Area under the curve using the Receiving Operator Curve)
of 0.8417. After performing our statistical analysis, we can conclude that the top 3 features that
have the most impact on heart disease are Difficulty in Walking, Age, and lastly, Stroke.
Therefore, we highly recommend the younger generation from the U.S. population routinely
check based on these attributed features that can significantly impact obtaining a cardiac
problem as they age.
